Thanks for downloading "fusion," a simple styled wordpress theme.

I'd like to go ahead and get this out of the way: This is NOT a "sponsored" theme,
you may at ANY TIME remove the link at the bottom of your page. To do this:
go to your administration panel and then presentation -> Theme Editor
and click on "footer" on the right menu. You Will see what to delete.

This theme is widget ready, each sidebar (main,post,page) is widgetable (is that a word?).

This theme is meant to be easy to edit so get to it!

If you do not know how to install (where are you from anyway?!):

Upload the "Fusion/" directory into your wp-content/wp-themes directory (via ftp)
and then go to the "presentation" tab on your admin panel and click on the pretty little screenshot. VIOLA!
